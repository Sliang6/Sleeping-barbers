# Sleeping-barbers

This problem is about simulating a barber shop with the following characteristics. The barber shop has a waiting room with M seats and a separate room with a single barber chair where the barber works. If there are no waiting customers, nor a customer having a haircut, the barber takes a break and sleeps. The moment a customer arrives, s/he wakes the barber up so that they can have their haircut. If another customer arrives while the barber is working, s/he will either sit in the waiting room (if there are available seats) or leave (if no seats are available).
